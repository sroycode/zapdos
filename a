## Compiling

Create a build directory

```
mkdir build
cd build
# Debug
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. && make
# Release
cmake .. && make
```

On Centos with cmake3 and custom Boost

```
# Debug
cmake3 -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/local/boost .. && make
# Release
cmake3 -DBOOST_ROOT=/opt/local/boost .. && make
```

Note the number of concurrent connections is limited by number of active threads, you can adjust it
by setting `LIBASYNC_NUM_THREADS` as an environment variable before compiling.

```
export LIBASYNC_NUM_THREADS=30
```
